Work Experience:

Since graduation I have gone down many programming paths. From technical consultation and prototyping for a start up (CUR), to bringing many different ideas alive at an incubator (BrandKnew), through which I was invited to a Nike Accelerator to spearhead the creation and launch of a wellness app utilizing a non public API for Nikes fuelband (FitCause), next was working on cloud television networks / digital signage to create higher visibility for content providers (xTV) and currently building a targeted content/brand distribution platform for messaging apps (Nooji Media).

Technical Experience:

I am always looking for new challenges / opportunities to learn / grow from. From my beginnings in college with fundamental languages such as (Java / C / C++) where I built a real-time 3D graphics game for my senior project, to dabbling in Android Mobile (Java), then jumped into web languages with (HTML / CSS / JS / JQuery / PHP / RoR), later to dive deeper into new web technology stacks such as MEAN (Mongo / Angular / express / Node with CSS3 / HTML5) and currently focusing on React/Redux with bots maintaining my constant drive in continuing to push myself to understand and wield new technologies.

Personal Ability:

As a programmer I strive to become evermore technically sound, but my true talents lie in the union of product management and development. I am an engineer; I plan, document and execute. I am a leader; I focus on understanding and utilizing individuals for their strengths, will take on any task and bring those around me together for a common goal. I am a communicator; I value transparency, collaboration and the patients needed to maintain everyone is on the same page. I am a problem solver; I am constantly analyzing situations, breaking them down and finding potential options. I am a team player; I am always willing to help, open to constructive criticism and although it is common for me to rise to the top I am humble in knowing there is always room to grow.
